    <h1>Privacy Policy for MeetMate AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: March 23, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>Welcome to MeetMate AI, a Chrome extension designed to enhance your Google Meet experience by capturing subtitles, allowing downloads, and integrating with the Gemini API for AI-powered insights. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use MeetMate AI. By installing and using this extension, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>MeetMate AI collects the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subtitles from Google Meet</strong>: When you enable subtitle capture, the extension records the text of subtitles displayed during your Google Meet sessions. This data is collected only when you explicitly start the capture feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini API Key</strong>: You may provide an API key for the Google Gemini API through the extension’s popup interface. This key is stored to enable communication with the Gemini API for processing subtitles or custom prompts.</li>
        <li><strong>No Additional Personal Data</strong>: The extension does not collect your name, email, meeting participant details, or any other personally identifiable information beyond the data explicitly provided or generated as described above.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The data collected by MeetMate AI is used solely to provide the extension’s core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subtitle Capture</strong>: Subtitles are temporarily stored in memory to display them in the draggable UI, allow downloading as a text file, or send them to the Gemini API (if you choose to do so).</li>
        <li><strong>Download Feature</strong>: Subtitles are formatted into a text file for download when you click the "Download Subtitles" button.</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini API Integration</strong>: If you opt to send subtitles or a prompt to the Gemini API, the extension uses your provided API key to transmit the data and retrieve AI-generated responses, which are then displayed in the UI.</li>
        <li><strong>No Other Purposes</strong>: Your data is not used for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond the extension’s intended features.</li>
    </ul>
